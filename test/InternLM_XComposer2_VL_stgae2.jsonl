Slow down: Wet roads can be more slippery, so it's essential to reduce your speed to maintain better control of your vehicle. This will also help you avoid hydroplaning, which can occur when the tires lose contact with the road surface.\n\n3. Use your headlights: Even though it's nighttime, it's essential to use your headlights to increase your visibility to other drivers. This will help you see the road and any potential hazards more clearly, and it will also make it easier for other drivers to see you.\n\n4. Be cautious of pedestrians and cyclists: In urban settings, there may be pedestrians and cyclists sharing the road. Be extra cautious when approaching intersections or areas where they might be present.\n\n5. Be patient: With the traffic being light, it's likely that you'll have more time to react to any changes in traffic or road conditions. Use this time to your advantage by being patient and driving defensively.\n\n6. Stay alert: Even though the traffic is light, it's still essential to stay alert and focused on the road. Keep an eye out for any potential hazards, such as potholes, debris, or other vehicles that might be hidden in the darkness.\n\nBy following these driving suggestions, you can help ensure a safe and smooth journey through the urban setting, even in the challenging conditions of a wet road at night.", "answer_id": "d5MWShEjrqrc6mE3Mo8P8y", "model_id": "InternLM_XComposer2_VL", "metadata": {}}
