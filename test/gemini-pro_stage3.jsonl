The barrier is necessary to protect both the workers and the drivers from potential accidents.\n\nThe presence of the concrete barrier can affect ego car driving in a number of ways. First, it can cause the ego car to slow down. This is because the barrier narrows the road, making it more difficult for the ego car to pass other vehicles. Second, the barrier can cause the ego car to change lanes. This is because the barrier may be located in the ego car's lane, forcing the ego car to move to another lane.
