The bus is an immediate factor for the ego car's driving behavior as it dictates the following distance and potential need for lane changes or stopping. A silver SUV is visible to the left of the ego car, positioned in an adjacent lane. The SUV's proximity and lane position are important for the ego car to consider when making lane changes or adjusting speed. A group of cyclists is observed on the right side of the road, moving parallel to the ego car. The cyclists are relevant as they may influence the ego car's decision to change lanes or turn, especially if the ego car intends to turn right. Directional signs are visible above the road, indicating lane directions and available turns. These signs are crucial for the ego car to understand which lane to be in for the desired route. A traffic light is visible in the distance, showing a green light for the lane the ego car is in. The green light indicates that the ego car can proceed, but readiness to stop is necessary if the light changes. Red and white traffic cones are placed on the right side of the road, creating a barrier between the road and the sidewalk. These cones indicate a section of the road that is not to be used, possibly due to road work or a hazard, and the ego car must stay clear of this area."}

The presence of multiple vehicles ahead suggests that the ego car should be prepared for potential stop-and-go traffic and should monitor the brake lights of vehicles in front to anticipate changes in speed. A worker wearing high-visibility clothing is visible on the right side of the road, near the traffic cones. The presence of a road worker indicates potential road work or an obstacle on the side of the road. The ego car should proceed with caution and be prepared for possible instructions or changes in traffic patterns. A traffic light is visible in the distance showing a red light. The red traffic light indicates that the vehicles in front of the ego car, including the truck, will be stopping. The ego car should prepare to stop as well, maintaining a safe distance from the truck. Traffic cones are placed in a line on the right side of the road, indicating a section of the road is closed off or there is ongoing road work. The cones suggest that the ego car should not attempt to move into the space next to it and should stay in the current lane.
