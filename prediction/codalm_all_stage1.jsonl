The bus is an immediate obstacle for the ego car, and its actions will directly influence the ego car's driving decisions. A silver SUV is visible to the left of the ego car, positioned in an adjacent lane moving in the same direction. The SUV's presence requires the ego car to be aware of potential lane changes or merging actions from the SUV. A group of cyclists is on the right side of the road, moving in the same direction as the ego car. The cyclists could affect the ego car's ability to change lanes to the right or may require the ego car to adjust speed or position to maintain a safe distance. A traffic light is visible in the upper right corner of the image, displaying a green light. The green light indicates that the ego car and other road users have the right of way to proceed through the intersection. Red and white traffic cones are placed along the edge of the right lane, indicating a separation from a closed lane or construction area. The cones signal that the ego car should not enter the lane to the right and should stay in the current lane or consider changing lanes to the left if necessary."}

The cement mixer truck is a large, slow-moving vehicle that could affect traffic flow and requires careful navigation around it. A motorcyclist is visible in the distance, ahead of the ego car, moving in the same direction. Motorcyclists are more vulnerable than car occupants and require additional space and consideration from the ego car. A traffic light is visible ahead, showing a green light. The green traffic light indicates that the ego car has the right of way to proceed, but it should remain alert for changes in the signal and for other road users who may be running red lights. There are traffic cones placed on the left side of the road, indicating a construction zone or road work. The traffic cones suggest that there may be road work ahead, and the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary.

The truck is white with visible identification numbers and has a rotating drum on the back. The size and position of the truck may obstruct the view ahead for the ego car, and its presence in both lanes may require the ego car to adjust its speed or change lanes to maintain a safe following distance. Several cars are visible in the distance ahead, driving in the same direction as the ego car. These vehicles are in the left lane and appear to be moving in the same flow of traffic as the ego car. The behavior of these vehicles will influence the ego car's speed and lane choice, as it will need to follow the flow of traffic while maintaining a safe distance. Directional signs are visible overhead, indicating lane directions and upcoming exits or roadways. These signs provide information on lane usage and potential exits, which may influence the ego car's lane choice and navigation decisions."}
