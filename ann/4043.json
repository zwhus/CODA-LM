  "suggestions": [
    "Considering the slow-moving vehicle ahead and the nearby pedestrians, the ego car should reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance from the three-wheeled vehicle in front. It should be prepared to stop or steer clear if the pedestrians step into the road or if the vehicle in front stops abruptly. Overtaking should be done with caution only if the opposite lane is clear and it is safe and legal to do so. Additionally, due to the state of the road and potential debris, cautious driving with a reduced speed is recommended until the ego car passes this segment of the road."
