    "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the mixer truck ahead, be prepared to come to a stop due to the red traffic light ahead, and remain alert for the movements of other vehicles in adjacent lanes. The ego car should also avoid any sudden lane changes that could bring it too close to the median strip or into the blind spots of vehicles in the next lane. Once the traffic light turns green, the ego car can proceed with caution."
