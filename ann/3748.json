    "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance behind the large vehicle in front, staying alert for any deceleration or stops that the vehicle might make, especially in case passengers are embarking or disembarking if it is a bus. Given the red traffic lights, the ego car should remain stopped until the lights change to green. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the dark-colored passenger car to the right for any lane change or merging activity, and be prepared to adjust speed or position accordingly. Maintaining a full stop and only proceeding on a green signal will ensure compliance with traffic laws and safety for all road users."
