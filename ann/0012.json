      "description": "A white car on the left side of the ego vehicle traveling in the opposite direction.",

    {
      "description": "A cyclist on the right side ahead, riding along the roadside",
      "explanation": "The cyclist's presence means the ego car should be cautious and ready to give space when overtaking to avoid any close encounters."

      "description": "Several pedestrians are seen on the right, walking parallel to the road, at a safe distance away from the driving lane.",

The driver should be especially vigilant for any pedestrians that might enter the roadway unexpectedly and for vehicles that might depart from the parking area on the right."
