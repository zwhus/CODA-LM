    "Maintain a safe following distance behind the silver sedan, monitoring its speed and brake lights for changes in traffic flow. Prepare to make a lane change if the debris ahead becomes an obstacle and there is a safe opportunity to do so. Keep speed consistent with the flow of the surrounding traffic while remaining vigilant for any changes in the road conditions or traffic patterns."
