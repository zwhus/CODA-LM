Maintain a safe distance from the roadside where the pedestrian and dog are walking. As for the traffic light, the driver should observe and be prepared to respond according to the signal once its state can be clearly identified. The driver should remain attentive to the behavior of the pedestrian and the dog, as well as other potential road users that might enter the scene."
