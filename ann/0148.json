Prepare to adjust lane position slightly to the left if needed, due to the barrier and traffic cone on the right that suggest a potential lane narrowing or redirection. Reduce speed accordingly to adapt to the low visibility conditions and keep an eye out for any additional road users or changes in the road state that may not be immediately visible."
