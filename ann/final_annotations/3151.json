    "Due to the large construction vehicle in front, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to slow down or stop if the construction vehicle makes unexpected movements. Additionally, the ego car should monitor the surrounding lanes, checking the mirrors and blind spots for vehicles that might attempt to merge into the lane to avoid the construction vehicle. The absence of immediate visible traffic lights suggests the ego car should proceed with caution, adhering to any roadwork or construction signs that may be out of the camera's view. Overall, the ego car should be ready to adjust speed and lane position with increased vigilance in response to the larger vehicle's presence and other cars' potential reactions."
