      "description": "A brown minivan is present in the center of the image, positioned on the road and facing the same direction as the ego car, partially obstructing the driving lane",
      "explanation": "As this vehicle is directly ahead, it significantly affects the ego car's ability to navigate the road safely and requires monitoring in case it stops or turns."

    {
      "description": "Several vehicles are visible ahead on the left, including a white car entering or exiting a petrol station, and multiple vehicles waiting at the intersection",
      "explanation": "These vehicles could merge into the ego car's lane or take unexpected maneuvers, thereby requiring the ego car's attention for potential adjustments."

      "explanation": "The green light indicates the ego car has right of way to continue straight, but the red arrow prohibits left turns. The countdown suggests the light will soon change, and the ego car should be prepared to stop if it cannot clear the intersection in time once the light turns yellow."

    "Since the light is green, the ego car should continue at a speed that will allow it to clear the intersection within the 6 seconds before the light changes. The ego car should monitor the minivan in front and prepare to stop if it initiates braking. The ego car should also be cautious and ready to yield to the pedestrians and the motorcyclist who are currently crossing the road to its right to ensure their safety."
