    "Maintain a safe following distance from the crane truck ahead, be prepared to slow down due to the heavy vehicles in front, and use turn signals in advance when considering changing lanes to overtake. Keep vigilant for any sudden movements from larger vehicles and adjust speed accordingly. As there are no vulnerable road users or traffic signs to consider in this scenario, the ego car should focus on safe maneuvering around the larger vehicles."
