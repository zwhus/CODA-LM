      "description": "A grey car directly in front of the ego vehicle with red brake lights on, likely indicating a full stop or slow-moving traffic ahead.",
      "explanation": "This vehicle's actions will directly dictate the immediate driving behavior of the ego vehicle, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop."

      "description": "A large bus is visible on the left side of the ego car, partially occupying the same lane as the ego car, and several cars are ahead in the same lane, with brake lights on.",
      "explanation": "The bus's position may limit maneuverability for the ego car, and the lineup of stopped cars indicates heavy traffic or a potential red traffic light ahead."

      "description": "A cyclist on the right riding away from the ego car on the sidewalk or bike lane.",
      "explanation": "The cyclist is not in the road and is moving in the same direction as traffic, which reduces the impact on the driving behavior of the ego car; however, the cyclist should be monitored in case they attempt to merge into the road."

    "Maintain a safe following distance from the grey car ahead, observe it for any signs of movement that would require the ego car to adjust speed. Monitor the vehicles on the left to ensure the bus does not pull into the traffic lane unexpectedly. Keep an eye on the cyclist and the pedestrian in the vicinity for any sudden movements towards the road. Prepare for any necessary lane changes in advance by following directional signs to navigate the upcoming intersection. Drive cautiously, respecting traffic laws and potential stop-and-go traffic."
