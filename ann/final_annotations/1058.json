    "Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck and cars ahead while monitoring their speed and brake lights for signs of slowing down or stopping. Be prepared to reduce speed if needed. Be particularly vigilant of the pedestrians and cyclists on the right and ready to react if someone unexpectedly enters the road. The fallen bicycle poses a minor road hazard that should be safely passed with ample clearance. As always, abide by traffic regulations and speed limits while maintaining situational awareness."
