      "description": "A vehicle with red taillights illumined, indicating it is either stopped or moving slowly ahead",

      "description": "Multiple workers wearing reflective vests and hard hats are visible on both sides of the road, suggesting road work or construction activity. They are around the edges of the lane in use and one is crossing in front of the truck, possibly directing traffic.",

Be prepared to stop if necessary, especially if the person on the right moves to cross the path of the ego vehicle. Follow the directional guidance provided by the traffic cones, and refrain from entering the restricted sections indicated by the red circular signs. Maintain vigilance for any sudden movements or signals from the construction workers which might require immediate action."
