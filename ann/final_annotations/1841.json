    "The ego vehicle should slow down immediately and prepare to stop or navigate around the construction vehicle. The driver should look for any road work signs, personnel directing traffic, or additional signals that might provide guidance on how to proceed safely. If it's safe to pass and there's sufficient clearance on the left side, the ego vehicle may carefully drive around the construction vehicle, ensuring not to enter the opposite lane of traffic. If the path is not clear, the ego vehicle should come to a complete stop and wait for the construction vehicle to move or for instructions from a road worker."
