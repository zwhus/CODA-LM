    "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicles ahead, especially the concrete mixer truck. Given the truck's position, the ego car should be prepared to slow down or stop. Since the right lane is obstructed by the concrete mixer truck, the ego car should check for a safe gap in the left lane and signal appropriately to change lanes if necessary to avoid being blocked by the stationary truck. Additionally, the ego car should be vigilant for any intended actions of the motorcyclist and other cars around it, ensuring to yield appropriately to avoid collisions and ensure a safe vehicle operation. Observing any instructions from the traffic sign once the content is clear is also essential."
