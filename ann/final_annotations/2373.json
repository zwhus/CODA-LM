    "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck considering the wet road conditions to allow for longer stopping distances. Prepare for potential stops or reduced speed ahead as the visibility is limited and the truck's brake lights are not visible, which suggests it might be moving slowly or be stationary. Do not attempt to overtake until visibility improves and it is safe to do so."
