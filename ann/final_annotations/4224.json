    "The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the bus and the tanker truck to allow for safe braking and maneuvering if either vehicle stops or changes lanes suddenly. The ego car should be prepared to slow down or change lanes due to the partial obstruction caused by the work on the right side. Additionally, the driver should be alert to any maintenance workers or other road users that might unexpectedly enter the road. Due diligence and readiness to adjust speed or change lanes is recommended for navigating through this mixed road environment safely."
