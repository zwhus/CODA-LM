    "Given the observed scene, the ego car should maintain a low speed and be prepared to stop due to the stationary or slow-moving sedan ahead and the security guard who may require the white sedan to stop. The ego car should be vigilant for the pedestrians behind the exit gate, especially if they approach the road, and keep an eye out for any individuals concealed by the parked cars on the right who may enter the roadway unexpectedly."
