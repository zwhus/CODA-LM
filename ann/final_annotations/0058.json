      "description": "A white minivan directly ahead of the ego car, occupying the same lane and facing the same direction. The vehicle seems to be stationary or moving slowly, as indicated by brake lights being on.",
      "explanation": "The minivan dictates the ego car's speed and following distance to ensure safety and react accordingly to its actions, as it is the immediate vehicle in front."

    {
      "description": "A white hatchback to the left of the minivan, partially visible and positioned diagonally in the neighboring lane. The vehicle is at a standstill due to visible construction ahead.",
      "explanation": "The hatchback's position and standstill nature indicate constricted lanes and possible lane merging ahead, which requires attention from the ego car driver."

  "suggestions": [
    "Given the situations observed, the ego car should reduce speed in response to the construction zone, maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, especially the silver minivan, and be prepared for the potential of workers entering the roadway. The presence of traffic cones and barriers indicates that lane changes and congestion may occur, so the ego car should monitor surrounding traffic and signals carefully to make safe lane changes if necessary. The ego car should also be watchful for possible pedestrians. Overall, cautious driving with heightened awareness is advised in this construction area."
