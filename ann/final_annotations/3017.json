    "The ego vehicle should slow down and maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer truck and the person on the ladder. It should stay alert for potential hazards from the worksite on the right, such as personnel entering the road or debris that could be hazardous. Lane positioning should be adjusted to the left within the lane to maximize distance from the parked vehicles and the construction zone. Continue to monitor for any movements from the person on the truck ladder and be ready to respond appropriately to ensure safety."
