It ought to keep a safe distance from the parked cars to the right to avoid any unexpected obstructions and remain alert for any emergent road signs or changes in road conditions. Additionally, the presence of trash bins suggests the ego car should be cautious and ready to react if any small animals emerge onto the road."
