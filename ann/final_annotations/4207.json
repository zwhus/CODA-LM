    "Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, be prepared to stop or slow down for it and any pedestrians who may enter the crosswalk. Stay vigilant of cars in adjacent lanes, as they may change lanes, especially if the construction vehicle stops or slows down. Monitor the pedestrian on the sidewalk and reduce speed when approaching the pedestrian crossing ahead. Overall, cautious driving with a lowered speed and heightened awareness in this congested area is advised."
