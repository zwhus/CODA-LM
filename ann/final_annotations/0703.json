    "Given the current traffic situation with a large truck and a specialized construction vehicle ahead, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from these vehicles and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to maintain a smooth and safe flow of traffic. The ego car should also be aware of the other vehicles in adjacent lanes and be cautious of any unexpected lane changes or stops."
