    "The ego car should continue to proceed while observing the green light but should do so with caution, especially accounting for the bus that could enlarge its trajectory into adjacent lanes and the motorcyclist who might attempt to overtake or change lanes abruptly. Furthermore, monitor the cyclists closely as they have the potential to move unpredictably. Maintain a safe following distance from all vehicles and be prepared to adjust speed or lane position as necessary while respecting the lane demarcations indicated by the barrier post."
