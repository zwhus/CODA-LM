    "Monitor the white sedan on the left for potential lane changes. Keep a safe distance from the SUV ahead to anticipate stops or deceleration. Be prepared to yield to any pedestrians, although they are currently behind barriers. Continue straight as the green light is on, but left turns are not permitted, so a different route may be needed if a left turn was planned. Navigate around the traffic cones and barriers without encroaching into the adjacent lane or pedestrian zone."
