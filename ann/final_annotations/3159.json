    "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck considering the reduced visibility and potentially slippery road conditions. It is advised to reduce speed and prepare to stop if necessary. The ego car should watch for any brake lights or indicators from the truck that may signal its intentions. It should also be prepared to change lanes if the truck appears stationary and there is the option to do so safely."
