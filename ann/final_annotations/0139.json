Additionally, the ego car should stay alert for any movement from the white van and be prepared to adjust its position if the van encroaches into the car's lane. Be watchful for pedestrians that may emerge between the parked cars on the right. Finally, respect the traffic cones by avoiding the left side and being prepared for possible lane shifts or roadwork ahead."
