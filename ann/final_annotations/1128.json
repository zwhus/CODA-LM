    "Reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance from the truck, being prepared to stop or slow down if necessary. Observe for any possible indication from the truck if it is turning or stopping. Be cautious due to the wet road conditions, which require lower speeds for safe handling. If the truck is moving slowly and overtaking is legal and safe considering road conditions and oncoming traffic, prepare to change lanes with caution."
