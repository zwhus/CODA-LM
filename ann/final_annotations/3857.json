The vehicle is branded 'SANY' and has hazard markings and reflectors along its rear and sides.",
      "explanation": "This vehicle's size and position may obstruct the lane and reduce visibility, requiring the ego car to possibly change lanes in order to maintain a safe following distance and continue traveling safely."

    "Due to the size and positioning of the construction crane vehicle in the right lane, the ego car should prepare to change lanes to the left, after checking for safe clearance and signaling intentions to do so. It should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicles ahead in the new lane. Additionally, it must continue to monitor the road conditions and speed to adapt to any changes in traffic patterns."
