    "Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck ahead, as stopping distances can be longer at night and the truck may obstruct visibility of the road ahead. Be prepared to change lanes if it becomes necessary to overtake the slow-moving vehicle, but only do so when it's safe and legal. Maintain awareness of the road signs for navigation purposes. Operate headlights and taillights for safety, and use high beams if necessary and when no other drivers are affected."
