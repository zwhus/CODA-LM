  "suggestions": [
    "Due to the industrial setting and the presence of workers and materials near the roadside, the ego car should proceed with caution, maintain a moderate speed, and be prepared to stop or maneuver if an obstruction appears. Regular scanning of the environment for any new risks that might emerge from the industrial activity is advised. Since there are no traffic controls or road markings visible, the ego car should also be ready to yield to any oncoming or crossing traffic that may not be immediately visible."
