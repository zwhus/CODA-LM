      "description": "A silver SUV is positioned to the left of the ego car, slightly ahead within an adjacent lane.",

    "The ego car should remain stationary and wait for the bus ahead to move before proceeding. It should monitor the SUV on the left for any potential turns that could affect its path. Keep a safe distance from the cyclists on the right to ensure their safety as well as that of the car. Since the traffic light is green, the car can proceed once the path is clear, but it should remain alert for any changes in the light or unexpected movements from road users. The presence of traffic cones on the right suggests to stay alert to the possibility of a changing road layout or unexpected road conditions."
