    "Given these conditions, the ego car should maintain a safe distance from the commercial vehicle to the right and be prepared for it to either merge or extend further into the lane. Additionally, the ego car should adjust its speed according to the flow of the vehicles ahead, while being cautious of the road conditions that may affect braking distances. No urgent maneuvers are indicated, but constant vigilance is necessary due to the large vehicle's proximity and the conditions of the road surface. If visibility is poor, the use of headlights and ensuring clear windshields will be important for safe travel."
