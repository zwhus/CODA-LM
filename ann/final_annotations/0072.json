    "The ego car should continue to follow the white sedan at a safe distance, monitoring its speed and behavior. Maintain awareness of the vehicles in the adjacent lanes, especially if the traffic begins to slow down or if those vehicles show intent to change lanes. Avoid moving to the right due to the presence of traffic cones and be prepared for possible changes in traffic flow due to road work or lane restrictions. Adjust the speed accordingly to maintain safety and flow with traffic while remaining vigilant for any unexpected actions from other road users. Continue driving in the current lane unless there is a requirement to change lanes for a designated route or detour. Always be ready to adapt to changes in the traffic situation."
