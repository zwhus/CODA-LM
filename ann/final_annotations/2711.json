    "Due to the large truck in the same lane ahead and the construction activity on the right side, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the truck. It should anticipate potential stops or slow movement from the truck and be vigilant for any construction workers or equipment that may enter the roadway. It is recommended to reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary while passing the construction area. Keep an eye out for any temporary traffic signs that might be obscured by the vehicles and stay ready to comply with them."
