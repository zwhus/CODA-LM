    "Due to the construction vehicle obstructing the lane, traffic cones indicating a work zone, and potential traffic congestion ahead, the ego car should reduce speed appropriately, activate its hazard lights if it's stopping or significantly slowing down in an unexpected traffic condition, and be prepared to change lanes if necessary while maintaining vigilance for any unclearly visible traffic signs or signals. If the lane is not passable, the ego car should signal and merge into the adjacent lane when it is safe to do so."
