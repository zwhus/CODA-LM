    "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead while monitoring its brake lights for any changes. Be ready to apply brakes if the truck's movement suggests heavier traffic or a potential halt. Consider a lane change if the truck stops and an adjacent lane is clear, but only proceed with a lane change after ensuring the adjacent lanes are safe to enter. Continue to observe the green traffic signal while being prepared to adjust driving behavior in response to other road users and potentially slippery road conditions."
