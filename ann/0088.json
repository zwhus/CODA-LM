    "The ego car should remain stationary behind the dark-colored SUV, ensuring a safe distance in case the vehicle ahead decides to stop suddenly. As the traffic lights are currently red, the ego car must wait until they turn green before proceeding. Given the presence of traffic barriers indicating physical road demarcation, the ego car should not attempt to change lanes to the right. Maintaining awareness of the traffic light changes and any potential road users that may enter the roadway from adjacent areas is also necessary for when the light turns green."
