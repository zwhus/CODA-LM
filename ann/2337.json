    "The ego car should reduce speed due to the wet road conditions to ensure safe stopping distances. It should continue to monitor the parked trucks, particularly watching for any movement from the blue truck on the opposite side that could suggest it is about to enter the road. Overtaking the parked trucks should be done with caution, giving a wide berth in case doors are opened or unseen pedestrians emerge. The ego car should also remain alert for any dynamic changes, such as the appearance of traffic signs, lights, or other road users not currently visible."
