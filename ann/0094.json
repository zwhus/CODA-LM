    "Monitor the silver sedan closely and prepare to slow down or take evasive action if necessary. Maintain a safe following distance from the white SUV ahead while also observing the red utility vehicle and the large truck further ahead for any changes in their driving behavior. Continue to stay alert and watch the green barrier for any indications of narrowed lanes or detours. Always be ready to adjust speed and lane position based on the road users' actions and any emerging traffic situations."
