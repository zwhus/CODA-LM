    "Maintain a safe following distance from the concrete mixer truck, being prepared for slower reactions from the heavy vehicle. Monitor the vehicles in the left lane in case they decide to merge into the ego car's lane, which would require adjusting speed or lane position. Pass the cyclist with sufficient lateral clearance to ensure safety. Be observant of any possible pedestrian activity close to the roadway and continue to scan the environment for any other potential hazards, adjusting speed accordingly to maintain safety margins."
