      "description": "Large, blue dump truck directly in front of the ego vehicle, with red tail lights indicating it is either slowing down or stopped.",
      "explanation": "The proximity and behavior of the dump truck directly impacts the ego vehicle's ability to move forward or change lanes."
    },
    {
      "description": "White tanker truck on the left, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, partially visible.",
      "explanation": "This vehicle is in close proximity and must be monitored for any potential lane changes or stops that could affect the ego vehicle's path."

  "vulnerable_road_users": [
    {
      "description": "Several pedestrians visible behind the metallic barriers on the right side of the road, at a safe distance from the ego vehicle.",
      "explanation": "While the pedestrians are not in the immediate path of the ego vehicle, they should be monitored should they enter the roadway unexpectedly."

  "traffic lights": [],
  "traffic cones": [
    {
      "description": "Orange traffic cones are arranged in a line on the right, indicating a roadwork zone or lane restriction.",
      "explanation": "These cones suggest that a lane is closed or there are obstacles on the road, advising caution and potentially a lane change if the current lane is blocked."

  "barriers": [
    {
      "description": "Metal barriers are set up to the right of the ego car, separating the road from the pedestrian area.",
      "explanation": "The barriers indicate that there is a restricted area that the ego car cannot enter, thus defining the driving path and ensuring the car remains in its current lane."

      "description": "Reflective markers are present on the road surface, enhancing lane visibility.",
      "explanation": "These will assist the ego car in lane-keeping, especially given the reduced visibility conditions."
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Given the proximity to the truck on the left and the flatbed truck ahead, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or slow down further if the flatbed truck's brake lights indicate deceleration. The presence of traffic cones suggests the ego car may need to adjust its lateral position within the lane slightly to the left but must not encroach on the adjacent lane where the tanker truck is located. Due to the wet road conditions and overcast weather, the ego car should proceed with caution, reducing speed to adjust for potentially slippery conditions, and remain vigilant for any changes in the pedestrians' behavior. Overall, the ego car should be prepared for potential hazards and drive defensively to ensure safety."
