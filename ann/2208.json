      "explanation": "The presence of the truck and potentially slow-moving or stationary activity ahead will likely affect the speed and lane choice of the ego car."

      "description": "A yellow truck is ahead in the same lane as the ego car, slightly skewed to the left with the cargo area extending into the lane, suggesting it might be moving slowly or stopped.",
      "explanation": "This indicates a potential obstruction in the ego car's path of travel that would necessitate a change in position or speed to avoid a collision."

    "The ego vehicle should reduce speed and maintain a vigilant watch for the construction workers and potential obstacles. It should follow the lead of the truck in front while preparing for potential stops or diversions. Furthermore, the ego vehicle should be ready to change lanes if the right lane is blocked or closed due to the construction activity. Maintaining a safe following distance from the construction truck ahead is imperative to allow for sufficient reaction time."
