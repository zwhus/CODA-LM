    "Due to the reduced lane width caused by parked vehicles and the narrowness of the street, the ego car should proceed with caution, maintaining a low speed, and be prepared to stop if any of the cars should pull out into the traffic flow. Additionally, the ego car should remain alert for other road users that may not be visible in the current field of view, such as pedestrians emerging from between parked vehicles."
