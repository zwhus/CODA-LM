    "Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, being prepared to reduce speed further if necessary. Monitor the yellow van in the adjacent lane for any signs of lane-changing or merging that might require the ego car to adjust its position or speed. Be alert for any traffic signs, signals, or changes in road conditions that become visible as the ego car approaches the construction vehicle. If a safe opportunity arises and a lane change is legal and necessary to maintain traffic flow, signal appropriately and change lanes with caution, ensuring not to impede the van's pathway. Stay vigilant for any unforeseen hazards that may be obscured by the large vehicle ahead."
