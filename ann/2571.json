    "Due to the limited field of vision ahead and the presence of the large cement mixer truck in the same lane, it is recommended that the ego car maintains a safe following distance to react to any sudden stops or changes in traffic flow. Overtaking should be considered with caution, observing adjacent lanes for safe merging opportunities, especially since the traffic cones indicate potential lane restrictions. With no traffic light visible, the ego car must stay alert to behaviors of other drivers for clues about road conditions and right of way. Slowing down is advisable until more information about the traffic flow is available."
