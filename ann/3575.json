    "Maintain a safe following distance from the large truck ahead, be prepared to react if it makes sudden movements, and stay within the lane boundaries marked by the reflective barriers. Since visibility ahead is restricted by the truck's size, the ego car should be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if necessary to maintain safety, given the traffic conditions become clearer ahead. Monitoring for any additional road users, traffic signs, or signals that may come into view is also important."
