      "explanation": "The van's brake lights and position directly influence the ego car's speed and following distance, requiring the ego car to slow down or maintain a safe distance to prevent a collision."

    "Maintain a safe distance from the van, staying alert for any sudden stops or turns. The ego car should have its headlights on to ensure maximum visibility and rely on its sensors to detect any other road users that might be difficult to see due to the low light conditions. The speed should be adjusted to ensure that the car can safely respond to the actions of the van in front and any other potential hazards that may arise due to the night-time driving conditions."
