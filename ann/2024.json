      "description": "There is a large commercial concrete mixer truck directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane. The truck has a distinctive cylindrical concrete mixing drum and is showing its rear lights indicating it is likely operational or moving.",
      "explanation": "The presence of the truck impacts the ego car's driving behavior as it is an obstacle that dictates the following distance and would require the ego car to change lanes to overtake if necessary."

      "description": "A traffic light is visible showing a red light to the right of the truck, potentially indicating a stop for the direction of travel of the ego car and the mixer truck.",
      "explanation": "The red light requires the ego car to come to a complete stop if it's intended for their lane, which would affect its behavior by necessitating deceleration and cessation of movement forward until the light turns green."

    "The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the cement mixer truck ahead, ensuring enough space to stop without risk of a collision. It should remain stationary and await the traffic light turning green before proceeding. Monitoring the truck's brake lights and any reverse lights, if applicable, to anticipate its movements will be important for safety. Additionally, the ego vehicle should be alert for any road users that may not be visible in the immediate vicinity of the truck or near the intersection that may influence the driving decision when the light changes."
