      "description": "A large truck is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane. The truck appears to be carrying a load, possibly a cement mixer, and has a large container structure that could limit the ego car's visibility of the road ahead.",
      "explanation": "The truck's size and the cargo it carries are important for the ego car to consider because they could hinder the ego car's ability to see traffic ahead clearly. Additionally, if the truck slows down or stops abruptly, the ego car needs to have sufficient space to react safely."

    "Due to the truck's size and potential for blocking the ego car's visibility, it is advisable for the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. This distance should be enough to allow for safe stopping or maneuvering in case the truck decelerates or stops unexpectedly. Until the road ahead is clear and it is safe to do so, the ego car should not attempt to overtake the truck. Consistently monitoring the road surface and staying alert for any changes or unexpected events is also recommended."
