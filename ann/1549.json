      "description": "A large green construction vehicle with a mixing drum is directly in front of the ego car, occupying the same lane and appearing to be moving in the same direction, with visible red tail lights that may indicate slowing down or stopping.",
      "explanation": "The large size and presence of this vehicle directly in front of the ego car affect the available driving space and require the ego car to maintain a safe following distance. The vehicle's tail lights suggest it might be slowing down, which necessitates readiness to stop or reduce speed."

    "Maintain a safe following distance from the construction vehicle ahead, monitor its signals for any intentions to turn or stop, and prepare to reduce speed if necessary. Keep an eye on the pedestrian to anticipate any potential road entry, and stay within marked lanes while observing the traffic situation ahead for a safe opportunity to overtake the construction vehicle if it impedes the flow of traffic and it is safe to do so."
