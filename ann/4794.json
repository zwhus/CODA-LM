    "The ego car should reduce speed due to the animal on the road, approach with caution, and be prepared to stop if the animal's behavior becomes unpredictable. Navigation should be adjusted to account for the parked cars and the ego car should monitor these vehicles for any signs of movement, such as lights turning on or doors opening, which could indicate a car preparing to enter the road. Awareness of the road layout indicated by the directional sign should also be maintained to anticipate the actions of other drivers."
