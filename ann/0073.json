Do not attempt a U-turn due to the posted sign and traffic cones. Stay alert for any instructions from the traffic director and be aware of the green light in the distance, while ensuring it applies to your lane before proceeding. Avoid the lanes indicated as closed by traffic cones and keep an eye on vehicles in adjacent lanes to avoid side collisions and to safely navigate changes in traffic flow."
