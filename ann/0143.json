      "description": "A bus ahead in the left lane, also moving in the same direction as the ego car.",

    "Maintain a safe distance from the red hatchback car ahead, be prepared to adjust speed accordingly. Monitor the yellow bus for any stop signals, and be ready to change lanes if necessary to maintain a steady flow of traffic. Keep a watchful eye on the cyclist to the right and maintain a safe distance, be prepared to slow down or change lanes if the cyclist enters the roadway. Continue monitoring the pedestrian near the cyclist for any changes in behavior that could impact road safety. Lastly, remain aware of the reduced road width due to traffic cones and barriers, adjust lane positioning if needed and proceed with caution through the construction area."
