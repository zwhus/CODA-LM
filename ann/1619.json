    "The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the motorcyclist, providing them with ample space should they decide to change direction or stop suddenly. The headlights should be used appropriately to ensure visibility without blinding the motorcyclist. Additionally, the vehicle's speed should be adjusted to the nighttime conditions, allowing for enough reaction time in case the motorcycle's behavior changes unexpectedly."
