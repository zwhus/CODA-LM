      "description": "A large commercial truck with a mixing drum, likely a concrete mixer, is directly ahead in the same lane as the ego car. It has working rear lights and is occupying most of the lane width.",
      "explanation": "The truck's size and the fact that it occupies most of the lane width directly affects the ego vehicle's ability to maneuver around it safely. The positioning in the same lane indicates that the ego car must maintain a safe following distance."
    },
    {
      "description": "Red taillights of several vehicles are visible in the distance, indicating traffic ahead is either slow-moving or stationary.",
      "explanation": "The presence of other vehicles with visible taillights suggests the traffic flow is active, which requires the ego vehicle to be prepared for potential slowing or stopping cars further up the road."

    "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck, preparing for any sudden stops or turns it may make. Monitor the lane due to the proximity of the concrete barriers on the right and be cautious of the glare from lights affecting visibility. No immediate lane change appears necessary unless further road signs or traffic behavior indicates it is required. Reduce speed if necessary to ensure a safe reaction time for any unforeseen events due to the large vehicle ahead and the night time driving conditions."
