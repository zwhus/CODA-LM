      "description": "A pedestrian is visible on the right side of the image, walking away from the ego car alongside the vending stall.",

      "description": "A pedestrian is observed near the roadside food stall, partially in the street, walking away from the ego vehicle.",
      "explanation": "The pedestrian's close proximity to the driving lane poses a potential risk if they decide to cross the street or move further into the lane, thus the ego vehicle should slow down and be prepared to stop if required."

    "Given the presence of pedestrians and potential road hazards such as the street vendor cart and debris, the ego car should proceed with caution, reducing speed and being prepared to stop if the pedestrian's walking path changes. While the other vehicles in view do not pose an immediate threat, the ego car should maintain situational awareness, especially given the wet road conditions which could affect stopping distances and vehicular control."
