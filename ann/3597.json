      "description": "A large truck directly in front of the ego car, with a dirty and partially covered tarp over what appears to be a load of sand or construction material. The truck is in the same lane as the ego car, occupying a position just a short distance ahead.",
      "explanation": "The truck's presence and close proximity directly affect the ego car's following distance and speed. The dirty and loose covering suggests potential for debris to fall onto the roadway, which necessitates caution and readiness to respond to road hazards."

    {
      "description": "A cement mixing truck to the left of the ego car, partially visible and positioned in the adjacent lane, also moving in the same direction",
      "explanation": "The size and operation of the truck may influence lane changes, and its blind spots require careful consideration by the ego car."

    "Given the large trucks carrying potential debris in front, the ego car should maintain a safe following distance and monitor the truck ahead for any debris falling onto the road. Approach the intersection with caution due to the red traffic light. The ego car should come to a complete stop at the traffic light until it turns green and ensure there is no debris on the road before proceeding. It is important to keep an eye on the truck in the adjacent lane for any potential lane changes or hazards as well."
