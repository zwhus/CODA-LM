    "Maintain a safe following distance from the blue car ahead and prepare to adjust lane position if necessary to avoid the debris. Continue monitoring the distance to the white car in the center lane for any potential speed adjustments or lane changes that may be required. Stay in the current lane due to the median barrier to the left. Without any traffic signs or signals dictating behavior, the ego car should adhere to standard road rules and driving behavior."
