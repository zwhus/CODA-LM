    "Given the road users and signs present, the ego car should reduce speed to comply with the temporary '20' speed limit sign, maintain vigilant awareness of the cyclists and roadside workers, and prepare for potential stop-and-go traffic due to the vehicles ahead. Overtake the cyclist only if there's sufficient space to do so safely and without entering the opposite lane, given the traffic cones and barriers which may narrow the lane. Stay alert for any unexpected movements by the roadside workers."
