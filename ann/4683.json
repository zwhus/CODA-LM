      "description": "A large construction vehicle with a green mixer drum, license plate partially visible, occupying the center of the lane directly in front of the ego car",

      "description": "A black sedan to the right of the construction vehicle and in the adjacent lane, slightly ahead of the ego car's position",
      "explanation": "The sedan's position and potential actions are relevant to the ego car for making lane changes or adjusting speed in response to the construction vehicle ahead"

If overtaking is necessary and legal, the ego car should ensure it's safe to do so by checking the adjacent lane and the sedan's position to avoid any collision risk."
