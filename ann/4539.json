    "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the large industrial truck, staying alert for any potential changes in the truck's movement due to its size and extended equipment. Be prepared to change lanes if the truck's behavior affects the drivability of the current lane. It should also monitor the minivan's movement closely as it may make turns or lane changes near the parking area. Always be ready to adjust speed or change lanes if any vehicle's maneuvers come into conflict with the ego car's path. Observe standard road safety precautions and account for guardrails which limit road width and pedestrian access."
