  "suggestions": [
    "Due to the presence of parked vehicles and the obstacles slightly encroaching on the roadway, the ego car should maintain a lower speed and be prepared to make adjustments, such as gentle steering maneuvers to avoid any potential obstacles. Constant monitoring for any changes in the behavior of road users, like the parked sedan or tricycles, is advised. With no traffic lights or signs visible, the ego car should also be vigilant for any non-signaled movement of other vehicles and pedestrians that might emerge from the surroundings."
