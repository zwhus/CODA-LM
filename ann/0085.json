Keep an eye on the sedan to the left as it may change lanes abruptly due to traffic conditions. Stay vigilant for traffic signals or signs that may come into view to guide further actions. Finally, watch for the pedestrian to ensure they have safely crossed the street before proceeding. Adjust speed according to the flow of traffic and be ready for potential congestion or stop-and-go traffic behavior ahead."
