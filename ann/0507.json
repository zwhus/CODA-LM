    "The ego car should reduce speed and follow the construction vehicle at a safe distance, preparing for potential stops or slow movement. If it's safe and legal to do so, and if the road markings permit, the ego car may consider changing lanes to overtake the construction vehicle to maintain a steady flow of traffic."
