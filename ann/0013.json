    "The ego car should slow down and maintain a safe distance from the fire engine, be prepared for sudden stops or changes in traffic due to the emergency vehicle's presence, and exercize extra vigilance for motorcycles and scooters that can change lanes abruptly. It should also monitor the parked cars on the left for possible movements. Furthermore, adhering to a lower speed due to wet road conditions is crucial to prevent skidding and to ensure better reaction times. The traffic cones indicate a lane closure or obstruction so the driver must be ready to change lanes if necessary. Continued observation of pedestrians and cyclists is important to respond safely to any unexpected entries into the roadway. Finally, the driver should prepare to respond to the traffic lights as they approach them."
