      "description": "A silver van directly ahead in the same lane, moderate distance away, seemingly moving slowly or stopped as it is not clear ahead of it.",
      "explanation": "This vehicle is a primary concern for the ego car because it dictates the speed and potential actions of our vehicle. We must maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for sudden stops or turns."
    },
    {
      "description": "A white SUV in the adjacent lane to the right, slightly ahead of the ego car, appearing to be moving at a similar speed as traffic flow.",
      "explanation": "Awareness of this vehicle is necessary for lane change considerations and to monitor in case it decides to merge into our lane or if its behavior affects the flow of traffic."

Monitor the white car to the right for any changes in speed or if it indicates and attempts a lane change. Be prepared for a change in the road layout ahead as indicated by the directional signs. Exercise caution under the overpass due to construction barriers, which could affect traffic flow and potentially require the ego car to merge or adjust position within the lane. Adjust speed to account for the possibly wet road conditions to ensure safety and control, especially since stopping distances may be increased."
