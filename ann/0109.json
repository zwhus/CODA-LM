      "description": "A black van directly in front of the ego vehicle, positioned centrally on the road, presumably moving slowly or stopped given its position close to the crosswalk",
      "explanation": "This vehicle's presence requires the ego car to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop or maneuver according to the van's actions."

      "description": "Several cars parked on the side of the road to the left, not obstructing the active driving lane",
      "explanation": "These parked cars do not immediately affect the ego car's path but do inform about potential road users that may emerge from in between parked cars. Vigilance is necessary."

      "description": "A white car is in the left adjacent lane, slightly ahead of the ego car.",

      "description": "Pedestrians crossing the road on the crosswalk to the right and in the distance on the left, indicating the ego vehicle may be approaching a traffic signal or that the pedestrian crossing phase is active",

    "The ego car should maintain a safe following distance from the black van ahead, be prepared to stop should the traffic light change, and monitor the white car's activity in the adjacent lane for possible lane-change or turn indications. Additionally, keep an eye on the bike lane and the movements of the cyclist to avoid any potential conflicts. Finally, be mindful of pedestrians on the sidewalk who may enter the roadway unexpectedly. Watch for any traffic signs or road state changes as the ego car progresses."
