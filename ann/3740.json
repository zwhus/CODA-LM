    "Given the presence of a large vehicle in the same lane and vulnerable road users in the vicinity, the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead to ensure there is sufficient time to react to any potential obstacles or changes in traffic flow. Despite the green traffic light, the ego car should remain cautious, particularly around the motorcyclists and cyclists, and be prepared for the possibility that the large vehicle ahead may behave unpredictably if it is part of road work operations. The driver should continue to monitor the road conditions and traffic signs for any updates or additional instructions."
