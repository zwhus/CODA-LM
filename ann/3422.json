      "description": "A small white car is visible further down the road in the center lane, also traveling in the same direction as the ego car.",
      "explanation": "The distance provides ample reaction time for the ego car, but its presence should still be monitored for potential lane changes or speed adjustments."

    "Given the presence of the white van in the adjacent right lane, maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to adjust speed or change lanes if the van changes its behavior. Pay attention to the traffic cones indicating a lane closure ahead; if in the left lane, prepare to merge right when it is safe to do so. Due to the wet road conditions, reduce speed accordingly and increase the following distance behind the white car in the center lane to account for the reduced traction. Monitor the road conditions for any further indicators of road works or obstacles."
