    "Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead, matching its speed if it is moving, and preparing to stop if it is stationary. Use low beam headlights to avoid blinding other drivers while ensuring visibility is maximized under the current low-light conditions. Stay vigilant for sudden stops or changes in the behavior of the vehicle in front."
