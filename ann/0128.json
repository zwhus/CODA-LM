    "Proceed with caution, particularly due to the pedestrian crossing the road, and the parked sedan which may limit maneuverability or visibility. Be prepared to yield to the pedestrian if they enter your lane, and maintain a safe distance from the parked sedan in case it starts moving. Also, watch for any pedestrians that may step onto the road unexpectedly from the right side. The presence of the scooter suggests reducing speed and ensuring a safe passing distance when approaching it."
