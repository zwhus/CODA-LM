It is advised to maintain a safe distance from the oncoming cement mixer truck and to move slightly to the left within the lane to safely pass the parked truck on the right, ensuring that the car is neither too close to the center line nor to the parked truck. The driver must also be prepared for possible changes in traction due to the road conditions."
