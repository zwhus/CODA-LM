    "The ego car should reduce speed significantly in this environment to anticipate and react to road users' actions promptly. It should be prepared to stop for the dogs, watch closely for pedestrian movements, and also be ready to maneuver around items in the road. Scan the surroundings constantly, as parked vehicles may obstruct visibility of other moving road users. Utmost caution is recommended given the complexity and unpredictability of the scene."
