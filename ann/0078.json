    "The ego vehicle should proceed with caution, maintaining a safe following distance from the white car ahead. It must also monitor the cyclists, especially the one preparing to cross, to ensure their safety and be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The vehicle should stay in the current lane due to traffic signs indicating the direction of traffic flow and avoid stopping due to the no parking sign. The presence of traffic cones and barriers requires reduced speed and heightened attention for potential road workers or further obstructions."
