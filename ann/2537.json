    "The ego car should maintain a safe distance from the truck ahead, being prepared for unexpected stops or changes in speed. The car should monitor the pedestrians on the side of the road and be ready to stop or slow down if they show any signs of moving onto the road. The presence of traffic cones suggests a need for reduced speed and caution, especially since there may be workers or machinery present. The ego car should navigate the area with loose road material carefully to maintain control and avoid skidding. Overall, the ego car should proceed with caution, adhere to the speed limit, and be prepared to adjust its trajectory or speed based on the actions of the road users and the road conditions."
