    "Maintain a safe following distance from the truck ahead, given its size and potential to obstruct visibility and reaction time. Monitor the vehicle in the left lane for any indications of merging into the ego car's lane, preparing to adjust speed or position if necessary. Since no traffic signs or lights are visible, continue to follow standard night driving precautions, such as reduced speed and heightened awareness of surroundings. Stay alert for any changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles that might not be immediately visible at night."
