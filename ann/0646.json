    "Maintain a safe distance from the large truck in front, being prepared to adjust speed if the truck slows down or stops. Monitor the white commercial truck on the left to anticipate any lane changes. Keep an eye on the motorcyclist on the right for any sudden changes in their position or speed. No immediate lane changes are advised given the current traffic arrangement, but if overtaking is necessary, ensure clear space and signal appropriately. Remain vigilant of the traffic scenario as a whole to adjust plans according to the evolving situation on the road."
