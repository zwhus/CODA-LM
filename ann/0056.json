      "description": "A beige bus is positioned diagonally in front of the ego-vehicle, partially occupying the ego-vehicle's lane and the next lane to the left.",
      "explanation": "The bus's diagonal position suggests that it may be in the process of merging or maneuvering, which requires the ego car to slow down and possibly stop to avoid collision."

    {
      "description": "Multiple vehicles are lined up in the ego car's lane behind the bus, suggesting slow traffic or a potential traffic jam.",
      "explanation": "The presence of these vehicles indicates congested traffic conditions, which necessitates that the ego car maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for stop-and-go movement."

    {
      "description": "Another bus is visible in the right lane, moving in the same direction as the ego car.",
      "explanation": "This bus may also stop to pick up or drop off passengers, and its actions could affect lane changes or merging decisions for the ego car."
