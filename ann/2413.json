    "Proceed with caution and prepare to reduce speed. Be ready to perform a lane change to the left if the road width and traffic conditions permit, to safely navigate past the construction vehicle. Ensure to check mirrors and blind spots before changing lanes. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle to allow for unexpected movements or doors opening. If unable to change lanes due to oncoming traffic or road rules, wait for a safe opportunity to pass the construction vehicle."
