Caution should be exercised when passing the parked vehicles on the right, ensuring not to veer too close and be prepared for any sudden obstructions. Additionally, the ego vehicle should obey any unidentified traffic signs as more details become visible and remain alert to the pedestrian's movement. No abrupt maneuvers should be made without confirming the pedestrian remains off the roadway."
