    "The ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance behind the three-wheeled vehicle, preparing to overtake if the vehicle slows unexpectedly and if it is safe to do so. The ego car should maintain awareness of the cyclists and pedestrians' proximity to the road, especially if they show signs of entering the roadway. Watch out for potential construction activity indicated by the parked truck and be prepared for construction-related traffic changes. Lane positioning should be adjusted according to the marked lanes and turning arrows, especially if preparing to make a turn."
