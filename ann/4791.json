Stay vigilant as the street lighting conditions are poor, which might reduce visibility of any additional hazards or road users not currently visible.",

Continue to observe the green traffic light and prepare for any changes in the signal as the ego car approaches the intersection. Keep an eye on the roadside objects to ensure they do not enter the driving lane, which could necessitate evasive maneuvers."
