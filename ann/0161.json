It should keep an appropriate distance from the black car on the left and be prepared for any shifts in its movement. The ego vehicle should also watch the cyclists and motorcyclist, ensuring a safe passing distance when overtaking and be attentive to their potential maneuvers. As the traffic light for going straight is green, no immediate stop is required, but the ego car should remain alert to changes in the light's status."
