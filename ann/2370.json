The vehicle should possibly switch to the left lane if it is safe and permitted, to avoid the area where the lifting platform is extending into the road. Additionally, the ego car should maintain vigilance for any further instructions or signs from the road workers or possible temporary traffic control devices that might not be visible in this image."
