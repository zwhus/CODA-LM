    "reference": "There is a black SUV in the opposite direction to the ego car in the left lane and  a white van in front of the ego car in the ego car lane. A motorcyclist wearing yelow hat is visible on the right side of the ego car, moving through the intersection. Motorcyclists are vulnerable, potentially leading to safety-critical situations. A directional sign indicating lanes for straight travel, assisting the ego car in navigating its route.  A green traffic light is visible straight ahead, allowing traffic to proceed through the intersection. On the side of the road, the orange barrier marks a risky area, alerting the ego car to potential hazards and the need for caution.",
    "prediction": "The green traffic light ahead informs the ego car that it has the right of way to proceed. The presence of a pedestrian crossing indicates that drivers should be alert for pedestrians. A black sedan and a sliver car in front of th ego car directly influences the ego car's driving behavior, requiring the driver to adjust speed and maintain a safe following distance. To the right of the image, there is a person riding a scooter.  This is a vulnerable road user who may behave unpredictably. There are barriers set up along the edge of the road on the right side, indicating some form of road work or a closed-off area. The ego car should stay clear of these barriers to avoid entering a potentially unsafe area.",
    "response": "The prediction text correctly identifies the green traffic light, barriers, two vehicles and the person riding a scooter. Although the colors and types of vehicles are slightly different, silver and white colors are similar, both the reference text and the prediction text describe small vehicles (SUV, sedan, van, and car are all equivalent), so SUV is predicted to be sedan, and van is predicted to be car. While there is no explicit mention of crosswalk markings in the reference text, they usually appear at intersections, so this is not an illusion. However, it did not mention the directional sign indicating straight line travel and the relative position of the vehicle was incorrect. So, Rating: [[8]]."
