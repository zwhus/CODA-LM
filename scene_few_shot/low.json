    "reference": "Numerous cars are parked on both sides of the road, resulting in a narrower space available for driving, which requires drivers to pay close attention. Ahead, there is a black truck traveling in the same lane in front of ego car, necessitating the maintenance of a safe driving distance. On the right, there are motorcyclists and cyclists moving in the same direction as the ego car, with a significant number of motorcycles and bicycles parked on the road. Traffic cones placed around indicate potentially hazardous areas. The driver's vehicle should recognize these to avoid obstacles, reducing the possibility of damage or accidents. A traffic light is visible ahead, but its color is unclear. Traffic lights control the flow of traffic, and the driver's vehicle must respond correctly to their signals to ensure safe operation. There is a no-entry sign ahead.",
    "prediction": "In this scenario, several objects could influence the driver's behavior. Motorcycles parked along the road require the driver to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from them to prevent accidents. Ahead, there is a black truck, and the driver should keep a proper distance. Pedestrians are present on the sidewalk ahead, and the driver should pay attention to them and be prepared to stop or slow down as necessary to ensure driving safety. There are many trees and buildings on both sides, which should not distract the driver's attention. To avoid being late, the driver wants to pass through the traffic light before it turns red, intending to overtake the vehicles ahead.",
    "response": "The prediction text successfully mentions the motorcycles parked by the road and the truck ahead. However, it completely overlooks the vehicles parked on both sides mentioned in the reference text, the people riding motorcycles and bicycles on the right side, and ignores the traffic cones and the no-entry sign. Additionally, the prediction text hallucinates the presence of pedestrians. As for the trees and buildings, they actually do not have an impact and do not need to be considered. The prediction text imagines the driver's psychological thoughts, which, although not present in the reference text, are acceptable if reasonable. So, Rating: [[2]]."
